Welcome to the Union Testnet! This guide will instruct you on running a node and creating a validator for `union-testnet-10`.

:::note
Currently, `union-testnet-10` has a fully permissioned validator set that is managed via the [strangelove-ventures/poa](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/poa/) module.
:::

## Steps

These are the general steps for running a node and creating a validator for the Union testnet.

### Hardware Requirements

You may run the Union node on your own machine or a VPS, please ensure your machine or VPS meets our [node operator requirements](/infrastructure/node-operators/requirements/).

### Running the Client Binary

To begin - you first need to obtain and run the client binary, `uniond`.

We offer both Linux binaries and Docker images that are capable of running the client binary.

#### Unionvisor

Unionvisor is a utility for managing `uniond` deployments. It manages running, upgrading, and interacting with the node. Read our guide for [Running Unionvisor](/joining-testnet/unionvisor/) to learn more.

#### uniond-release

For more manual control, we also release each version of `uniond` as a Docker image. You can learn more in our [Running the Client Binary](/joining-testnet/obtaining-uniond/) guide.

### Getting Testnet Tokens

Tokens will be distributed by the Union team to those that need them to create their validator or conduct testing.

### Creating a Validator

Once you have the tokens required to create a validator and have synced your node, you can follow our [Creating a Validator](/joining-testnet/creating-validators/) guide to complete your onboarding.
