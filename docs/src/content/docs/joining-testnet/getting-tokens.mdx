To participate in the Union Testnet, you will first need an account with a U balance.

U is the primary token for the Union Testnet. We technically represent U as `au` a fixed point representation of U with 18 digits of precision. This means that a balance of `1000000000000000000au` is equivalent to 1 U.

To ensure a fair initial distribution of Testnet tokens to validators, we will be supplying your accounts with an U balance.

## Getting a Testnet Account

Before you can get a Testnet address, you will need to [obtain and run the `uniond` Docker image](/joining-testnet/getting-started#running-the-client-binary).

Once you can run `uniond`, you can either create a new account, or recover one from an existing mnemonic.

:::caution

Regardless the method used to set up your Union Testnet account, we recommend **NOT** storing the account on the server running your node.

:::

### Create a New Account

To create a new Account and mnemonic, use the following sub-command of the `uniond` binary.

```sh frame="none"
uniond keys add $KEY_NAME
```

_Where `KEY_NAME` is the name you would like to use when referencing your key._

Make sure to securely store the new mnemonic phrase that was outputted by the command.

You can also take note of your `address` here and continue to [Receiving Testnet Tokens](#receiving-testnet-tokens)

### Recover an Existing Account

To recover an Account using an existing mnemonic, use the following sub-command of the `uniond` binary.

```sh frame="none"
uniond keys add $KEY_NAME --recover
```

_Where `KEY_NAME` is the name you would like to use when referencing your key._

Take note of your `address` here and continue to [Receiving Testnet Tokens](#receiving-testnet-tokens)

## Receiving Testnet Tokens

### Finding your Union Address

To ensure your account will have an U balance, please submit the address from your newly created or recovered account.

If you haven't already noted down your address, you can retrieve it with the following command:

```sh frame="none"
uniond keys show $KEY_NAME --address
```

_Where `KEY_NAME` is the name you would like to use when referencing your key._

### Finding your Validator Address

To find your validator address you can run the following `uniond` sub-command:

```sh frame="none"
uniond keys show $KEY_NAME --bech=val --address
```
