# SAFE - Ethereum Multisig to Babylon Multisig

To start a multisig transfer with SAFE, you will first need a multisig account created with https://app.safe.global/.

Once you have a multisig created, you can follow the steps below to conduct your transfer with Union BTC.

## Steps

1. Go to the "My custom apps" tab and click "Add custom Safe App"

5. With your wallet connected, you can now select the asset you would like to send, and it's destination. In this case, we're selected uniBTC on Ethereum as the source asset and uniBTC on Babylon as the destination asset. Then set your amount.

6. Set the receiver. In our case, a Kelpr multisig account. To do this, go to your Kelpr multisig account and copy the address. Then go back to Safe and select the wallet icon. Here, paste in the Kelpr address you copied.
