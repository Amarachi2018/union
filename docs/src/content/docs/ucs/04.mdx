title: UCS04 - Universal Chain ID
---

Chain IDs as reported by chains themselves are unfortunately not universally unique. For example, ID `1` is used for both Ethereum and Aptos.

To disambiguate, UCS04 defines `universal_chain_id` as `<chain_family_name>.<chain_id>`.

## Universal Chain IDs

### Union

- `union.union-1`
- `union.union-testnet-10`
- `union.union-testnet-9`

### Ethereum

- `ethereum.1`
- `ethereum.17000`
- `ethereum.11155111`
